# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction

 Highlights
Converts .wav audio files to Mel-spectrogram images

Applies data augmentation techniques (time shift, noise, pitch, stretch)

Trains a ResNet50 CNN for binary classification

Implements K-Fold Cross Validation

Designed to run in Google Colab

ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used

Librosa â€“ audio loading, processing, augmentation

OpenCV â€“ resizing spectrograms

TensorFlow/Keras â€“ deep learning model

Matplotlib â€“ visualization

NumPy, os, random â€“ data handling

ðŸ§ª Model Architecture

Base Model: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Input: 224Ã—224 RGB Mel spectrograms

Layers:

Global Average Pooling

Dense layer with ReLU

Output: Dense layer with sigmoid for binary classification

ðŸ“ˆ Training Approach

Processes each audio file into 5 spectrograms using augmentation

Ensures a balanced dataset of spectrograms from both classes

Uses K-Fold validation to split and train on different folds

Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, loss, etc.

ðŸ§¬ Dataset

This project assumes a dataset of .wav files organized into two folders:

PD_AH â€“ for Parkinson's speech recordings

HC_AH â€“ for healthy control recordings
